# Project Aerria
This was a game we start 5 year ago with 3 others friends.
We worked like 6 month on the game (when it's the first time trying to make a game it take time to write code)
The game is slow and unoptimized but it was fun to work on it.

The game was indented to be a Terraria like (2D sandbox).
The game was done using SFML and C++.

This is one of the first game I've tried to do.
We didn't go far developing the game, everyone was still student in programming/art etc.

Feel free to check but be aware the code is unoptimized and bad (and the comment are in French)
If you want to test the game you can download the latest build done 5 year ago here [direct link](http://vps.kirthos.dyjix.eu/Site/Games/Aerria.rar)
